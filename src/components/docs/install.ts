// <Install />: the install block (DOCS-PLAN.md §3.4, ADR-0013). One content
// model, rendered twice: Install.astro turns it into the page's tabs and code
// blocks, and `toMarkdown` turns it into the twin (one `###` per outer tab,
// one `####` per inner tab, every code block in full).
//
// The Agent tab and the AGENTS.md block name no version (ADR-0060): the Agent
// tab is the setup prompt every copy-for-agent button shares, and the
// AGENTS.md block is the one the docs landing copies. The Pinned binary steps
// (agent-quickstart) take their version from src/content/docs/_data/engine.json,
// never typed, so a release bump re-pins them.
//
// Facts and where they come from (upstream, reading material only):
//   - install.sh installs the latest release only (it has no version
//     selector), so pinning goes through the release download URL, with the
//     same three checks install.sh makes: the SSHSIG signature on SHA256SUMS
//     against the pinned key (namespace and identity `relate-release`), the
//     signed `# relate-release-version: vX.Y.Z` header, and the binary's
//     SHA-256 (distribution/install.sh, RELEASING.md "Signing key"). Releases
//     up to and including 0.16.1 carry `cypherlite` in those names instead
//     (`releaseNames`, by publication date: relate restarted its version line
//     at 0.1.0), so the pinned blocks name what that release shipped.
//   - The key and its fingerprint: distribution/release-signing-key.pub
//     (`ssh-keygen -lf` prints the fingerprint).
//   - `relate --version` and the envelope bytes of `RETURN 1 AS ok`: read from
//     the runs recorded in src/content/docs/_data/engine.json (`version_check`,
//     `envelope_check`), which `npm run docs:cli-check` replays against the
//     binary. The envelope carries per-phase timings that change on every run
//     (relate 0.1.0, upstream ADR-0540), so the pages print it with each
//     timing value written `<ms>` (`maskTimings`, ADR-0054) and say so. The skill agent names and `relate skill install` writing under
//     the home directory: recorded from the binary in _data/cli.json
//     (`commands[skill].recorded`).
//
// Props (literals): `part` picks what renders.
//   (none)       the three tabs, then the AGENTS.md block under a bold label
//   "tabs"       the three tabs: CLI, Package, Agent (the setup prompt)
//   "agent"      the Agent prompt alone
//   "pinned"     the Pinned binary steps alone
//   "agents-md"  the AGENTS.md block alone
