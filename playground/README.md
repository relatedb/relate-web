# Relate Playground

Browser playground for running Relate in-process via WebAssembly, with
Neo4j NVL for graph visualization. Published at `/playground/` as part of
this site: `npm run build` at the repository root builds it into
`dist/playground/`. Moved here from the Relate repository's
`examples/wasm-playground/`.

## Stack

- The site's WASM engine, `public/wasm/` (a copy of the Relate repository's
  `surfaces/relate-wasm/pkg/`; see the root AGENTS.md to refresh it)
- Vite 5 + React 19 + TypeScript 5, kept as their own package (this
  directory's `package.json` and lockfile), separate from the Astro site's
  toolchain
- Neo4j Needle (`@neo4j-ndl/react`), `@neo4j-nvl/react` for the graph view,
  `@neo4j-cypher/react-codemirror` for the editor

## Build

```sh
npm ci --prefix playground          # once, from the repository root
npm run dev:playground              # http://localhost:5173/playground/
npm run check:playground            # tsc
npm run cookbook:browser            # after a build: the playground and the cookbook hand-off in headless Chrome
npm run build                       # the site, then the playground into dist/playground/
```

The engine is not bundled. The worker (`src/lib/engine.worker.ts`) loads
`/wasm/relate.js` and `/wasm/trap.js` at runtime, so the playground, the
cookbook, and the home page's console share one engine file, and refreshing
`public/wasm/` updates all three. Its types come from
`public/wasm/relate.d.ts`. The site serves `/wasm/` in production; the
`site-wasm` plugin in `vite.config.ts` serves it from `public/wasm/` to the
playground's dev server.

The build keeps the tuning it had upstream (`vite.config.ts`): terser rather
than esbuild (esbuild's minifier breaks labelled statements in dagre and
cypher-language-support), React in one chunk (NVL's React wrapper needs a
single binding), and an explicit dependency pre-bundle list. The `build`
script also raises Node's heap to 6 GB, as upstream's deploy did: the
manual-chunks pass over the CodeMirror and NVL vendors needs more than
the 2 GB heap Node gets on a GitHub runner, and fails there with
"JavaScript heap out of memory".

## Running queries

The editor accepts several statements separated by `;`. They run with the
engine's own script runner (`executeScript`), which splits with the CLI's
scanner and stops at the first error; the results pane shows the last
statement's result, with counters summed over the script. Each statement
commits on its own.

The editor and the terminal prompt keep separate drafts. After a run the
editor keeps the query that ran (typed, a sample, a schema-browser click),
highlighted and ready to edit; the terminal prompt clears. Clicking a past
input in the terminal puts it in both. Never show a query as the editor's
placeholder: CodeMirror does not highlight placeholder text.

## Graph view

Double-clicking a node in the graph view adds its neighbours from the
playground's database: up to 100 of its relationships and the nodes at their
other ends, plus the relationships between those nodes and the ones already
drawn. The view grows up to 1,000 nodes. The status in the bottom-left corner
says what was added, and its **Reset** puts the view back to the result. The
queries are the cookbook graph view's (`expandNode` in the site's
`src/lib/cookbook/graph-model.ts`); `src/lib/expand.ts` runs them on the
playground's engine. A new result, and each expansion, refits the camera
around everything drawn.

## Cookbook links

Cookbook steps link here as `#recipe=<slug>&cell=<id>`. The playground then
fetches `../cookbook/<slug>/recipe.json` (format 1; any other format is
refused with a message), shows the step and asks before running anything. On
confirmation it fetches every parameter file it needs, then resets the
database, runs the recipe's earlier steps, and puts the step in the editor
unrun; the replay stops at the first step that goes other than the recipe
says, by the cookbook pages' own rule (imported from the site's
`src/lib/cookbook/cells.ts`). When the step has a parameter file, those
parameters go with every query run from the editor until **Clear** or a
database reset. A recipe page's **Open in playground** links to
`#recipe=<slug>` with no step: the playground runs every step of the recipe
and leaves the editor empty. Once a recipe is loaded, the sample-query list
holds its steps instead of the sample data's queries (setup steps left out),
labelled by the heading each sits under (`title` in recipe.json); a step's
button runs it with its own parameter file, which also becomes the editor's.
**Reset** brings the sample data's queries back. Docs pages link the same
way as `#docs=<page>[&cell=<id>]`: the playground reads the page's markdown
twin, `../docs/<page>.md`, for its cells and parameters blocks; a block the
twin links instead of carrying (a ```` ```json data=<name> src=<url> ````
stub, ADR-0049) is fetched from `../docs/<page>/data/<name>.json` on this
site and checked against the stub's size and SHA-256 before it runs. See `src/lib/recipe-link.ts`,
`src/hooks/useRecipeSession.ts`, and `src/components/RecipeDialog.tsx`.
